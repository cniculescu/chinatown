#### About the Project
<br>
A mountain village at the water. Block 65b is on the east bank of Haveneiland, where the city canal runs into the IJ-meer. This canal separates block 65b from 65a, a block designed by Attika Architekten as a huge mountain with spacious terraces that recede like the steps of a ziggurat. Block 65b owes its village-like character to the detached small-scale buildings that are connected with one another by walkways and form an open block with an intimate en- closed garden and a small harbour. The two blocks combine to form an unusual landscape entity that is the sum total of various dwellings and outdoor spaces.

The structure of Block 65b and the various terraces yield a striking combination of urban density and an openness towards the city and the landscape. The tension between visibility and privacy plays an important role for the residents of this ensemble. The 23 apartments, 2 maisonettes and single penthouse have therefore been so designed that it is always possible to escape from the gaze of your neighbours while at the same time feeling that you are part of an urban community. Most of the apartments have three or even four outer walls, which makes them seem like detached homes.

The appartments are gathered around a communal inner-court. This negative space generated is explored through different methods. First, a mass of this space illustrate how this semi-public place is frangmented and highly articulated. Second, is an exploration through different elements that can possibly animate this space and how the building, treated as a void, is carving its surroundings.
