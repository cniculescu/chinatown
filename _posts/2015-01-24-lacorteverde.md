### About Cino Zucchi

Zucchi was born in Milano, Italy in 1955. Educated at Cambridge, Massachussetts, he is now a practicing architect as well as author, editor, and professor. 

His recent works include the Keski Pasila master plan in Helsinki, residential and office buildings in the former Alfa Romeo area in Milan, the Group M office building in Assago (Milan), the Salewa Headquarters in Bozen, residential complexes in Milan, Parma, Ravenna and Bologna, the new Lavazza headquarters and the restoration and extension of the National Automobile Museum in Turin, which won the Inarch/Ance 2011 award for architecture. The design for the former industrial area of the ex-Junghans in Venice received many national and international awards including mentions at the Mies van der Rohe Award - Barcelona 2001, the Medaglia d’oro dell’Architettura Italiana 1995-2003 e 2004-2006, and the Brick Award 2004, the Piranesi Award 2001, the Premio di Architettura “Comune di Venezia” 2005 and the ECOLA Award 2008. 

### Negative Space

This project, completed in 2013 in Porta Nuova, Milan, Italy, serves as a point of transition in the city. In this respect, the negative space in the building serves a critical role. The building assists to facilitate an “urban metamorphosis” (ArchDaily) between the new towers in the North and the existing urban fabric to the South.

The higher volume on the northern side of the building relates to these higher towers while the lower volume to the site conforms to the street profile in that direction.

The court functions as a private garden, separated from Via Rosales to the West by a low wall. The living areas of the residence face onto this court, overlooking it with balconies which form a screen to the garden. The bedrooms, facing Via Viganò to the East, are buffered from the street by a large green area. The two façades of the building are connected by corridors at ground level. Looking through the corridors from Via Viganò offers a narrow view of the private garden of the court.
