#### About the Project
The project is made with a careful insertion of different volumes in a sculptured composition. The buildings are made with a mix of steel structure and precast concrete panels. The buildings are covered with wooden tiles in order to give a natural and homogenous texture all around the building. The creation of glass terraces for each flat is able to improve the heating installation of the building with a natural system.

The plinth of the block is formed by 1-2-storey public, shop, and office premises. Six 3-8-storey timberclad apart- ment blocks are set on top of the plinth. The pieces form an artistic, independent composition, which is bold and allows the project to fit well in its setting.

Variation was brought by dividing the blocks into two different types of structure: construction dominated by multi-storey blocks on the side of the city and lower build- ings on the side of the ridge.

#### Adapting to Human Scale

#### Using Negative Space
The project is conscious of movement, and the interaction between the built and natural environment.
The project uses negative space to seamlessly join the interior and ex- terior spaces while also reducing the overall footprint of the structure.
Cantilevering the structures over the plaza creates thresholds and boundar- ies allowing the program to translate to the exterior environment.
