### BIG Philosophy

A mix of charles darwin and friederich nietzsche. the evolution of ideas through adaptation and improvisation is how architecture thrives. “yes is more” refers to the allowing of creativity, not the suppression of ideas. by saying yes, we evolve and grow as a society, and do not stagnate in a defiance to change.  

### About the Project

A cathedral-like apartment, with dramatic angles and peaks. The dense prismatic volume is opened by a series of perforations and a central, communal atrium. These openings stimulate environmental and social interaction. An integrated town square and garden further enrich the urban fabric.

#### Town Square
This open space has multiple functions. It acts as a buffer zone between buildings, overcoming a sense of confinement. The square can breathe, supporting the residents and their desire to interact publicly. The slope adds a playful element and reflects the character of the building.

#### Atrium
The atrium provides the residents a space for private interaction. It expands through the core and engages the outside through a series of balconies, walkways and windows. The atrium allows for natural light and airflow through out the residence. It acts as an internal reflection of the exterior.

#### Garden
The garden is a reflection of the community. It houses traditions and stimulates communal growth literally and figuratively. It is a private space for introspection and relaxation. It is a scenic space, providing views from within and from the balconies above.
