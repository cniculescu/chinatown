#### Feng Shui in Landscape Design

A successful Chinese classical landscape artist is one who succeeds in making the elements in a garden look as if they are part of nature and in harmony with nature.
It must have a composition that consists of:

* shumi deyi (contrast of openness and closeness) 
* quzhe jinzhi (full of curved and straight lines)
* yanqian youjing (view and vista in front)

To achieve these objectives the following techniques have to be applied: 

* zhushan (making hills)
* lishui (creating water)
* zhiwu peizhi (placing elements in appropriate positions)
