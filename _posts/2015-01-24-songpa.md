### SsD Philosophy
<br>

SsD is an architecture firm that approaches design as a convergent, interdisciplinary venture that aspires to bridge the utopian and the pragmatic. Instead of separating aspects of architecture, urbanism, landscape, history, social systems, and codes into their constituent disciplines, these essential design ingredients are simultaneously explored so that minimum form gains maximum effect. In this way sustainability emerges as an integrated rather than additive result. 

‘Work’ for us is equal parts research and production. Without research, production becomes a repetition of previous solutions without sensitivity to the dynamic conditions of site and culture. Without production, research exists as an untested set of theories, compelling in their potential but unable to develop beyond generalities. Interweaving research and production allows one to inform the other in a continual learning process. Each work demands its individual solution that balances the aesthetic, social, functional, and ecological with an economy of means.

### SsD on Songpa Micro Housing Project
<br>

The problem of urban density and housing costs is global. As unit types get smaller however, land costs coupled with developer driven profit margins can merely create a provisional housing type with little social value. By mining the discrepancy between maximum floor area ratios and maximum zoning envelopes, Songpa Micro-Housing provides a new typology that extends the limits of the housing unit to also include semi-public circulation, balconies, and the thickness of walls. Like the ambiguous gel around a tapioca pearl, this ‘Tapioca Space’ becomes a soft intersection between public/private and interior/exterior, creating social fabrics between neighbors. 

Fourteen ‘unit blocks’ allow residents to either claim a single space, or in the case where a couple or friends desire to do so, recombine the blocks for larger configurations. This flexibility accommodates changing live and work situations allowing residents to occupy the building longer and therefore more sustainably. Further generating the idea of community, exhibition spaces on the ground floor, basement, and second floors are spatially linked to the units as a shared living room. Although the zoning regulations requires the building to be lifted for parking, this open ground plan is also used to pull pedestrians in from the street and down a set of auditorium-like steps, connecting city and building residents to the exhibition and cafe spaces below. 

The building is owned and operated by the innovative artist collective Everyday Mooonday.
