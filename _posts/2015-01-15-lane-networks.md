#### Familiar Places

Chinatown first came into its own as a neighborhood sometime in the late 19th century, clustering around two alleys in the early days. Shanghai and Canton alleys were the center of the community in these early years. Growing south from Pender street, the two alleys ran parallel to one another and formed the tiny district which was
the only place within the new city where Chinese immigrants could feel at home. Soon Shanghai alley was host to a small theatre,
a public market, and the living room for the community. Here stories were exchanged, opinions argued, and associations formed. The alley was intrinsic to the character of Chinatown from its beginning. As the Chinese population grew, these two alleys became the western border of Chinatown and lost some
of their vitality as the tight-knit community began to spread out.

However, the alley still remained the truest expression of the Chinese culture in Vancouver. Here the residents felt a familiar scale, a familiar sense of commrodory and community. The lanes became a place where their culture could spill forth and bring them together, all while avoiding the exposure of the high streets.

#### The Green Door

> “I remember delivering to a couple of places in Chinatown and the guys would be smoking opium in the back kitchen.”

Market Alley was a prominent area for Chinese shops and businesses in the early 1900s. Prior to 1909, when Canada outlawed narcotics, market alley was a source for opium production. Well-known among the community was the notorious Green Door Restaurant. Tucked into the shadowy doorways of Market Alley, the Green Door was simply that- an unadorned green door. Different stories relay the information differently, some say there was a secret knock, others say the doorman looked out and decided if you could enter. The patron would walk into what has been referred to as “an all night party”.

Today you can walk right past it without noticing, the vibrant green now masked under a coat of quickly weathering red paint. No signals remain of the once lively nightlife that the alley supported.

#### The Riot

> “‘Don’t put on the lights! And don’t sit near the windows!’ They were running through all the lanes, making all kinds of noise. We had no lights on, so they couldn’t see us.”

In 1907, with the prosperity of the 1897 gold rush fading, racial tensions reached a boiling point. Within the first six months of the year, over three thousand Japanese arrived to the city. Chinese and Japanese workers were being hired over white workers. Growing anger amongst white Canadians fueled organizations such as the Asiatic Exclusion League. Racism rampant in the city, the September riots spilled into the narrow lanes of Chinatown. Windows were smashed and residents hid within their homes until the crowd moved along. Some members of the community sought reparations for the damages, but most swallowed their hurt, boarded their windows, and flooded a local gun store the next day to be prepared for another attack. Canton alley, the heart of the community, had an iron gate placed at its entrance. The community viewed it as their fortress should another such riot take place.

#### Forgotten Spaces

The alley is now used for utilities such as deliveries, garbage pick up and housing of hydro lines. The fire escapes, which add character to the lane ways, have fallen into disuse and do not adhere to more recent codes, therefore are removed from new and restored structures. With the back-door entrances no longer possible due to restrictive city codes, the stoops along the alley now play host to the disenfranchised of the area.

The secluded nature of the alley, which was once a refuge for the Chinese immigrants for their shops and businesses, now acts as a secluded area for drug use and trafficking. With the introduction of “China White” heroin in the 1990’s, the drug use and trade skyrocketed in Vancouver’s Chinatown. From then to now, injection sites have been opened in the area to move users out of the alleys. However, the alleys remain a common area for drug users, needle drop boxes often being located in the alleys.

The Chinatown redevelpment plan developed by the city acknowledges the necessity to engage these alleyways in order to restore the cultural significance they once held for the community.
