#### About the Project
Saragaku is a shopping center in Shibuya, a district of downtown Tokyo. It was designed by Akihisa Hirata and completed in 2007.

With a narrow site in a densely populated area, Hirata created a valley-shaped pedestrian space surrounded by mountain- shaped volumes to give a human scale to an urban environment.

#### Akihisa Hirata Office
Akihisa Hirata is a Japanese architect based in Tokyo. Established in 2005, his office has taken on projects ranging from museums and pavilions to hotels and collective housing.
Hirata’s design philosophy centres on following nature’s lead to solve problems. He believes the role of the architect is simply to give shape to the gathering of people—both visually and experientially— by exploring the relationship between indoor and outdoor.

#### Sunlight & Sightlines
By stepping back the facades of each building, the valleys between the buildings receive more sunlight and unique sightlines are formed between indoor and outdoor spaces.

#### Human Scale
Narrow corridors between the built forms create intimate “veins” that become more human-scaled as they branch away from the main courtyard.
