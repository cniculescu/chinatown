##### Vancouver Convention Centre
![Roofscapes](/images/roofscape-3.jpg)<br>
This LEED Platinum convention centre by LMN, DA Architects & Planners, Musson Cattell Mackey Partnership (MCM) is located with a spectacular view of Vancouver’s waterfront. Described as “simultaneously a building, an urban place, and an ecosystem,” the building features a six-acre green roof populated by native flora and fauna.

##### Fuji Kindergarten
![Roofscapes](/images/roofscape-4.jpg)<br>
The Fuji Kindergarten fully utilizes its roof deck to effectively double the space for young students to
learn and grow. Three zelkova trees, preserved from
the original site, shoot up through the roof and provide
a unique playground in the middle of a dense urban environment.

#### The Keefer
###### 133 Keefer St.
![Roofscapes](/images/roofscape-5.jpg)<br>
This warehouse, built in 1907, has been renovated to feature a trendy bar at street level, upscale residence, and a penthouse with an unusual roof. The 2400 square foot roof deck includes a pool that creates a skylight for the penthouse suite below. It is a seemingly unlikely location to attract the attention of Vancouver’s jet-set.

#### Wing Sang
###### 51 E Pender Street
![Roofscapes](/images/roofscape-6.jpg)<br>
New life has been breathed into the historic Wing Sang building. It is houses the Rennie Collection, a large collection of contemporary art. The roof of the building was not forgotten in its renovations. It features a green roof by Considered Design Inc in collaboration with Jon Losee Landscape Architects Ltd. The three permanent exhibitions are visible from this vantage.

#### Chinatown Plaza
###### 338-268 Keefer Street
![Roofscapes](/images/roofscape-7.jpg)<br>
This unused rooftop parking lot offers an incredible view. Seven stories up, Vancouver’s North Shore mountains are stunning and the Downtown East Side is spread out before you. The hip and gable roof of the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen garden is visible. So, too are cranes, betraying what is coming to Chinatown.

#### BlueSky Chinatown
###### 633 Main Street
![Roofscapes](/images/roofscape-8.jpg)<br>
A newcomer to Chinatown, this 16-story condo development is slated to be completed in 2015. It offers luxury rental housing with retail space at street level. Atop the structure can be seen the trees and bushes characteristic of an intensive green roof. Green roofs are notable for their benefits in stormwater management, urban heat island mitigation, air purification, habitat provision, and many others.
