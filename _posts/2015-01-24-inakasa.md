<h3 class="h3 r700">La Corte Verde</h3>
Alexis LÃ³pez Acosta

#### Framed City, Projected Court
<br>

The Inakasa Building seeks to create an urban response to a suburban context. The negative spaces within the design are formulated in such a way to create the relations found between the city and the city apartment. Deep terraces are punched into the rough concrete facade, framing views of the city and the natural landscape around it. The courtyard within is revealed when the building envelope lifts from the ground plane, projecting the serene space into the surrounding neighborhood. These nega- tive spaces attempt to bring life and dynamism into the area, which was formerly an industrial park and still struggles to support a lively density. The negative, which accounts for nearly half of the whole, is an expression of the desire for a building that will function as part of a renewed fabric, and encourage a more metropolitan behavior in the surrounding streets.

The structure relishes in the undetermined; the in between and ambiguous urban condition. The negative spaces are a negotiation between public and private, the city and the individual.
